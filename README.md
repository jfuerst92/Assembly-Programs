# Assembly-Programs
A collection of some MASM Assembly programs I've written. Only the ASM files are added here. Uses the Irvine32 Library which can be found here: http://kipirvine.com/asm/

Projects included: (simplest to most complex)
Sum.asm - calculats the sum of two integers given by the user
FibonacciNumbers.asm: calculates the amount of Fibonacci Numbers requested by the user.
IntAvg.asm: Calculates the average of integers that a user enters.
composites.asm: calculates the number of composites that a user requests.
